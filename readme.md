# Deployment

Ansible scripts for setting up my personal systems. Feel free to poke around, but be aware that I'm not a professional sys-admin so there's no guarantee anything here is done the correct way.

# Setup

Currently tested on Fedora 33 (minimal install with standard packages).

Run with:

```sh
wget --no-cache -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ngarside/deployment/master/setup.sh | bash
```
